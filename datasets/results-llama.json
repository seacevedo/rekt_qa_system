Keeping projects online in some form after they have been officially deprecated creates an environment that increases the likelihood of governance attacks like the one on Atlantis Loans.\n4. **Increase auditing and testing cycles**: Implementing more rigorous quality control, including increased testing, may help spot similar vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious actors.\n5. **Promote communication within affected ecosystems**: Encourage projects to maintain open communication with users who still have active contracts or interactions ongoing with abandoned protocols like Atlantis Loans, in order to raise awareness of potential risks and vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, note that the effectiveness of these steps depends on the overall security practices and standards in place at each project.", "answer_orig": "Although developers abandoned the Atlantis Loans defi lending project in early April due to \"financial difficulties\", as a self-executing defi protocol it has continued to chug along rather like a zombie.
