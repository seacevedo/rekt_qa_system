6de23b94,CryptoPunk sells for a fraction of its likely market price due to zombie smart contract,2024-09-11,"A rare CryptoPunk NFT recently sold for only 10 ETH (~$25,300), despite a market value that's likely around 600 ETH (~$1.5 million). The sale went through thanks to lingering smart contracts from a defunct NFT fractionalization platform called Niftex, which allowed people to buy and sell ""shards"" of various NFTs. Niftex launched in November 2020, and is now defunct, with its domain redirecting to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.The platform's smart contracts remain operational, however, and so despite the lack of a frontend website for the platform, the backend still remains. A trader was able to use these smart contracts to trigger a feature that allows a buyout of the fractional shard holders which, if not countered by someone else, automatically goes through in 14 days. The bidder proposed a purchase of 0.001 ETH per share, and without an operational Niftex frontend, no one noticed. The bid went through, and the trader successfully purchased all 10,000 shares — and thus, the NFT — for 10 ETH.Since then, several people have offered to purchase the NFT for amounts ranging from 100 to 605 ETH. If the new owner were to accept the 605 ETH bid, they would 60x their purchase price.One owner of a fractionalized share said he thought he had managed to successfully block the sale, but miscalculated. ""GG to the new owner"", he wrote. He wrote on Twitter, ""I don’t consider this a heist.  It’s an arb.  The smart contract worked as intended. If you want decentralized systems you have to take the good with the bad.  It’s part of the game.  It’s why we’re here.   If you don’t like those rules, you probably shouldn’t be playing.""",Hmm

According to CertiK, they discovered a bug in the exchange software, which they tested with multiple transactions over several days. Some of these were large transactions, which CertiK said they performed to test whether Kraken had alerting in place to detect higher-value transfers. When they reported the vulnerability to the exchange, they say the exchange patched the bug, but then threatened CertiK employees and demanded they repay a ""mismatched"" amount of crypto allegedly taken during the testing period.However, others have noted that the number of transactions and amount of cryptocurrency taken by CertiK while ""investigating"" the bug seems to far exceed the norm for whitehat security researchers, and that they took cryptocurrency amounting to millions of dollars — making their ""testing"" look a lot more like a blackhat theft. Furthermore, CertiK made several transfers to Tornado Cash as part of their ""testing"" — an entity that is sanctioned by the United States.Kraken alleged that CertiK did not disclose the full extent of their employees' transactions, and refused to return the $3 million they had taken. They also alleged that CertiK had attempted to extort them.

This wouldn't have been Shkreli's first foray into the blockchain world, after he launched a ""web3 drug discovery platform"", and then later dubiously claimed to have been hacked for over $450,000 after his computer was infected by a trojan after he torrented a porn video.Shkreli attempted to frontrun the news in a Twitter space, and came out with his own claims that he had collaborated with Barron Trump to create the token, and with Andrew Tate to pump its price. However, fellow felon and memecoin pumper Roger Stone subsequently crawled out of the woodwork to claim that neither Barron nor Donald Trump was involved with $DJT.Shkreli has yet to provide solid proof that he created the memecoin, though zachxbt's research tends to be very strong. If true, Shkreli faces potential legal repercussions, as he is still on parole after his release in 2022. The terms of his parole require him to ""refrain from engaging in self-employment which involves access to client's assets, investments, or money, or solicitation of assets, investments, or money"", and to make financial disclosures to the courts.

6616b352,"""Decentralized"" social network Farcaster criticized after confiscating channel name to be used by influential crypto podcasters",2024-02-15,"One of the promises made by proponents of crypto-focused decentralized social networks like Farcaster is that you can't be de-platformed by centralized companies, and you maintain control over your own presence on these platforms.This made it a bit of a shock when the co-founder of the a16z-backed Farcaster blockchain-based social network messaged a user to inform them that he would be taking away the channel name he had registered, whether he agreed to it or not. According to the co-founder, Dan Romero, the popular Bankless crypto podcast had requested the bankless channel name, which the user he was messaging had already registered.After the user argued back against Romero's offer of $25 in USDC to reimburse him for the channel name, and said it set a poor precedent, Romero stated: ""ok this isn't productive. do you want USDC for the refund or warps"" (referring to the non-crypto points used by the Warpcast client for Farcaster).On one hand, some criticized the user who had registered the name for allegedly squatting on the channel name and trying to resell it. Romero defended his decision by arguing, ""I never said channels were decentralized yet"" (though the platform does generally claim to be ""sufficiently decentralized""). Others argued the action set a bad precedent, and flew in the face of the ethos supposedly motivating these types of web3 social networks.Romero has promised on Twitter that Farcaster channels ""will be onchain later this year and like [user identifiers] won't be able to be touched."" When pushed on the precedent this sets, he replied, ""So let the squatter extort money?"" Romero clearly needs to grapple with the fact that, like it or not, squatting is a feature of systems that take a hands-off approach to managing access to identifiers. This should not be news to anyone remotely familiar with the web, where ""domaining"" emerged out of the relatively laissez-faire structure of DNS — though unlike with fully decentralized identifiers, there can be some intervention when domain name speculation enters the realm of cybersquatting.","Hmm, Shady business"

Players who had completed an Otherside minigame would be eligible to mint these NFTs for free. However, the ""free"" NFT cost around $30 in gas fees to mint. Worse still, the parts were meant to be repeatedly traded and combined to make new parts and ships, leading fans to wonder why on earth they decided to release the project on a blockchain where each transaction often costs tens of dollars.Apparently realizing they'd made a mistake, Yuga first responded by announcing they would gift people free ""Catalyst"" NFTs to make it up to them. This only sparked further rage, though, as it was seen to dilute the value of the Catalyst NFTs and throw off incentives.Yuga later reversed course on this decision, instead deciding to reimburse the gas fees.This was not Yuga Labs' first gas-related fiasco, after they caused gas fees to spike into the thousands of dollars across the entire Ethereum network in April 2022 during the initial Otherside land sale.One observer wrote, ""[W]hat's the plan for the marketplace in Otherside that is supposed to support millions of daily microtransaction?

Eager to get in on the Azuki action, people snapped up the 2 ETH (~$3,750) NFTs, netting Azuki 20,000 ETH (~$38 million) in primary sales alone. All NFTs were sold in the presale, meaning only existing holders of Azuki NFTs were able to buy in to the new project. As is somewhat common, the artwork itself was not visible prior to sales, meaning people bought the NFTs without knowing what they would look like until the art was revealed.The mint itself was plagued with issues, with many collectors complaining they weren't able to buy NFTs due to technical difficulties. A team member apologized for the issues, writing that they were ""gutted over what happened"" but that ""we have an amazing reveal experienced planned that will kick off soon"".When the reveal happened, people were disappointed to say the least. They expected a unique look that would not ""dilute"" the value of the original Azuki collection, and were met with what many feel is a low-effort clone of the original Azukis. Some observed NFTs in the Elementals collection that appeared to be direct duplicates of ones in the original collection, which Azuki later wrote was a ""technical glitch"" that was quickly corrected. The floor price of the Elemental NFTs, as well as those of other Azuki projects, immediately suffered. While people paid 2 ETH for the NFTs, they're now going for 1.5 ETH (~$2,825) at floor, a 0.5 ETH (~$925) loss. The floor price of the original Azuki collection tanked from ~15 ETH (~$28,200) to ~9 ETH (~$16,920), a 6 ETH ($11,280) loss.Azuki wrote an apologetic thread on Twitter, writing that they had ""missed the mark... the mint process was hectic, the PFPs feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki.""

Coinbase decided that instead of any real attempt at convincing them not to, they would use the incident as a PR opportunity to try to win hearts and minds (of the public but also critically in Congress), convincing people that the SEC was being unfair to them and stifling innovation in the United States and all sorts of other things.The SEC, apparently unconvinced by Coinbase's usual spiel, filed a complaint with five claims for relief involving operating without registering with the SEC and offering unregistered securities by way of providing a cryptocurrency staking program.Coinbase has responded with its usual bluster, and vowed to fight the lawsuit.

b3d07e58,Swaprum decentralized exchange rug pulls for almost $3 million,2023-05-18,"Decentralized exchange Swaprum, a project on the Arbitrum layer-2 network, suddenly disappeared with around 1,628 ETH (~$2.96 million) in an apparent rug pull. The thieves then mixed the money through Tornado Cash.The project had been audited by blockchain security firm CertiK, and displayed the ""audited by CertiK"" badge on their website. This added to criticisms of CertiK, who have come under fire for auditing multiple projects that later turned out to be scams. CertiK defended themselves, writing that, ""As an auditor, we cannot force projects to implement our recommendations, but we can clearly and publicly call out vulnerabilities where we find them"". They argued that they had identified vulnerabilities within their audit that ultimately allowed for the exploit, including the high degree of centralization and the upgradability of the smart contracts.",Rug pull
8dd59229,Sam Altman's Worldcoin project incentivizes a black market for biometric data taken from people in developing nations,2023-05-18,"""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.""Sam Altman's Worldcoin project, a dystopian effort to use chrome orbs to scan the irises of people (often in developing nations) in exchange for vague promises of crypto compensation, is encountering even more difficulties. In April 2022, BuzzFeed News and MIT Technology Review both published in-depth reporting on some of the technical and ethical issues the project has run up against.Now, the project is facing reports that people in China, who are not allowed to sign up legitimately, have been purchasing iris scans from individuals in Africa and Southeast Asia in order to circumvent the restriction. According to the news outlet BlockBeats, Chinese individuals have been engaging in ""eyeball speculation"": buying biometric data scanned en masse from villagers in Cambodia, Kenya, and elsewhere by people who then sell it for $30 or less, allowing the buyer to receive the associated Worldcoin payout (currently ~$20).Worldcoin has said they are rolling out various measures to try to discourage this activity, including changing the in-person sign-up process. However, the project acknowledged that they have not figured out how to prevent this, writing: ""Despite these precautions, it is important to acknowledge that they do not entirely safeguard against collusion or other attempts to bypass the one-person-one-proof principle. To address these challenges, innovative ideas in mechanism design and the attribution of social relationships will be necessary.""","Bad idea, Hmm, Yikes"
c951b361,Former Fabric CFO accused of siphoning $35 million into his crypto startup and losing it all,2023-05-17,"Nevin Shetty, the former chief financial officer of the Fabric e-commerce platform, was federally indicted for wire fraud after allegedly misappropriating $35 million from Fabric to put into his cryptocurrency platform HighTower. Shetty stole the money in April 2022, shortly after being told he would be fired from Fabric for performance reasons.According to the grand jury indictment, Shetty planned to put the funds into cryptocurrency positions that ""could have yielded returns of 20 percent or more annually"", and planned to return 6% to Fabric, keeping the difference. This so-called ""investment"" contradicted the conservative investment strategy that Shetty had helped to draft for Fabric, and he concealed both the existence of the transfer and his involvement with HighTower.Shetty ""lost virtually all of [Fabric's] money"" ""within a matter of weeks"", at which point he fessed up to Fabric. Shetty had placed all of the funds into protocols based around the Terra stablecoin, which collapsed dramatically only a month later.Shetty has pled not guilty, and has been released on bond.","Law, Shady business"

0ab488b8,South Korean legislator Kim Nam-kuk resigns over allegations of improper crypto dealings,2023-05-14,"South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk has resigned over a cryptocurrency scandal. On May 8, 2023, The Korea Times reported that Kim cashed out around 800,000 Wemix tokens priced at around ₩6 billion (~$4.5 million) in previously unreported cryptocurrency assets shortly before Korea's March 2022 imposition of the travel rule, which requires disclosures around the identities of those involved in large crypto transactions. Kim denied the allegations, claiming he had simply moved the assets to another exchange. Other legislators and citizens expressed shock at Kim's apparent crypto wealth, as he had portrayed himself as someone who was not affluent.Other concerns arose regarding the discovery of the assets. Some were worried about possible conflicts of interest, particularly in relation to Kim's 2021 proposal of a bill that would delay taxation of crypto profits. Others were worried about the source of the funds used by Kim for crypto trading; Kim claims he did not receive money from anyone to use for trading, and obtained the money through the sale of stocks.On May 10, the Democratic Party recommended Kim sell his crypto holdings, and launched an investigation. Kim said later that day that he would perform the sales, and ""transparently disclose data to the investigation team and undergo the inquiry faithfully"".On May 14, Kim resigned from the Democratic Party ""for a while"", continuing to deny the allegations but expressing wishes to not burden the party and its members over the controversy.The subsequent day, Korean authorities raided the offices of Korean crypto exchanges Bithumb and Upbit in connection to the scandal, seeking transaction records and other information. Kim was reported to use those services for his crypto wallets.","Hmm, Law, Shady business"

As is becoming a trend in the industry, crypto exchanges and other platforms appear to be finding investor protection to be fundamentally incompatible with their business model.This is only the latest in a string of events involving regulatory pressure on Binance. In April, Binance canceled the acquisition of the bankrupt Voyager platform by its Binance.US arm, citing a ""hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the US"".

2bc0f1b5,Aragon DAO faces governance crisis,2023-05-11,"As the Aragon Association took steps to ""progressively decentralize"" their centralized project by assigning more control to the Aragon DAO, they encountered some challenges. Aragon, somewhat ironically, is a platform for creating and running DAOs that has been ""stewarded"" by the Aragon Association, a non-profit run by a small committee.In June and October 2022, the Aragon DAO — that is, all holders of the $ANT token or (later) their delegates — voted on several proposals supporting a move to place the Aragon treasury under DAO control. The treasury is a pool of crypto assets currently priced at around $174 million. However, the tokens continued to remain under control of the Aragon Association.On May 9, 2023, the Aragon Association announced that they would not be following through with the treasury change, and instead would be ""repurposing the Aragon DAO into a grants program"". They attributed the decision to ""coordinated social engineering and 51% attack"" on the DAO that began shortly after a small portion of the treasury assets were transferred.A week before the announcement, Aragon also banned a group of token holders from the group's Discord channel. Aragon characterized the group as appearing ""coordinated"" and alleged the group was ""engaging in harassment"". They claimed the group were members of the ""Risk Free Value Raiders"", which they described as ""a sophisticated, well-resourced, and coordinated group of actors that target crypto projects with an imbalance between the value of their token and treasury"". They also accused the group and its members of coordinating governance attacks on other DAOs, including  Invictus DAO and Mango Markets. Aragon wrote that they believed the RFV Raiders were aiming to ""[extract] value from Aragon for financial profit"" rather than pursue the DAO's goals of supporting developers building DAO infrastructure.One of the banned members told a different story, publishing and later taking down a statement in which he claimed that they were trying to get answers to questions about why the Aragon team was so slow to enact the DAO vote. ""We find these bans, failure to empower the community with treasury transfers, and overall lack of transparency to be frustrating and against the ethos of both what DAOs are meant to be and what Aragon team members have repeatedly said they stood for. However, these actions have become a common pattern for Aragon,"" he wrote.On May 11, Aragon apologized for how they handled the crisis, unbanned the banned Discord members, and announced that they would ""keep following a gradual [treasury] transfer approach, making sure it aligns with the mission of the project"", but continued to characterize the members as attackers and reiterated that ""we won’t stand for hostile and coordinated attacks"".",Hmm
