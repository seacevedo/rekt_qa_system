These drainers are \"scam-as-a-service\" products, where the drainer creators allow others to operate the drainer software in exchange for a 20% cut of stolen funds.The victim wallet sent a message to the thief, offering \"a peaceful resolution to this situation\" in which the thief could keep 20% of the total amount taken (around $6.5 million).\n",

      "Summary: A staking platform called Bedrock lost around $2 million after exploiters discovered a bug that allowed them to swap 1 ETH for 1 BTC despite the more than $63,000 difference in prices for the two assets.A security firm working with Bedrock had tried to warn Bedrock of the vulnerability several hours before the attack, but the team was asleep. The vulnerable contracts had been deployed a day and a half prior to the attack, and had not been audited.Fortunately for Bedrock, security groups were able to pause third-party projects surrounding Bedrock, which helped to limit the losses — which ultimately could have been as high as the entire value of funds on the protocol.\n",

      "Summary: The Onyx protocol was hacked for a second time by attackers taking advantage of known bugs in forks of the Compound Finance project. Projects regularly fail to patch these bugs, despite many instances of multi-million dollar hacks affecting Compound forks in the past.Onyx apparently didn't learn their lesson the first time around, when they were exploited for $2 million in November 2023 by an attacker taking advantage of a known vulnerability affecting empty markets on the protocol. This same bug seems to have contributed to this exploit, although Onyx has claimed the hack was due to a separate vulnerability in an NFT liquidation contract.\n",

Holding $OPENAI will grant access to all of our future beta programs,\" the scam tweets claimed. A link in the tweets directed users to a malicious website that invited users to connect their wallets to claim tokens.This latest hack is only the latest in a slew of Twitter account compromises \"announcing\" a scam token. Over a year, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati had her account hacked to promote an \"$OPENAI\" token.

Some of these were large transactions, which CertiK said they performed to test whether Kraken had alerting in place to detect higher-value transfers. When they reported the vulnerability to the exchange, they say the exchange patched the bug, but then threatened CertiK employees and demanded they repay a \"mismatched\" amount of crypto allegedly taken during the testing period.However, others have noted that the number of transactions and amount of cryptocurrency taken by CertiK while \"investigating\" the bug seems to far exceed the norm for whitehat security researchers, and that they took cryptocurrency amounting to millions of dollars — making their \"testing\" look a lot more like a blackhat theft. Furthermore, CertiK made several transfers to Tornado Cash as part of their \"testing\" — an entity that is sanctioned by the United States.Kraken alleged that CertiK did not disclose the full extent of their employees' transactions, and refused to return the $3 million they had taken.

The hacker was able to take advantage of a bug in the project's smart contract in the logic to calculate swap fees. Using a flash loan attack funded through Tornado Cash, the attacker drained most of the tokens from the pool, bridged the tokens back to the Ethereum mainnet, and then tumbled the stolen funds back through Tornado.In an unusual move, the operators of the Linea layer-2 blockchain chose to unilaterally halt the chain in order to stop the outflow of stolen assets. Because Linea — like many layer-2 chains — is highly centralized, it was possible for the Linea team to unilaterally stop the production of blocks.This was very controversial, as a single operator being able to unilaterally control the operation of a blockchain goes against much of the cryptocurrency ethos. Following their action, they tried to explain that \"Linea's goal is to decentralize our network - including the sequencer. When our network matures to a decentralized, censorship-resistant environment, Linea's team will no longer have the ability to halt block production and censor addresses - this is a primary goal of our network\".\n",

MEV involves previewing upcoming transactions on a blockchain and taking actions to extract additional profits — which can sometimes be substantial — based on that information.According to the Justice Department, the Peraire-Buenos exploited a flaw in popular MEV software called \"MEV-boost\", which is used by most Ethereum validators. By creating their own validators and \"bait transactions\", they were able to trick MEV bots into proposing transactions involving illiquid cryptocurrencies, which the brothers then frontran. They were able to create false signatures that tricked a MEV-boost relay into releasing information about upcoming blocks that they were able to tamper with.The brothers were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and face up to 20 years in prison for each charge.The Justice Department is describing the case as a \"first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain\". The case is an interesting one, as some believe the practice of MEV itself exploits Ethereum users. Others believe anything you can do with code should be allowed — \"code is law\". However, by signing false transactions and tricking the relay into releasing private information, the brothers' actions do seem to go beyond simply making profits in a \"code is law\" Wild West, and into the realm of actual fraud.\n",

As a result, on April 30, an attacker was able to upgrade the project's smart contracts to malicious ones, then withdraw $1.68 million in ETH, ARB, and OP tokens.Pike Finance has offered a 20% reward for the return of the funds or information pertaining to the attacker, and has promised \"a plan to make users whole\". Pike, which launched in early 2024, is backed by Circle and Wormhole.\n",

      "Summary: Jay Mazini, an influencer who often boasted of his wealth on Instagram by doing cash giveaways to random strangers, has been sentenced to seven years in prison after running \"overlapping fraud schemes\" that scammed victims out of at least $8 million. One of them involved a multi-million dollar cryptocurrency scam in which he would promise to pay higher prices for crypto, and would convince those who were interested to transfer their funds to him by providing doctored images of wire transfer confirmations to suggest that he'd fulfilled his end of the deal.Mazini also ran a scam targeting the Muslim community in New York, via a company called Halal Capital. In reality, this was a Ponzi scheme, and payouts to his investors were funded in part by the crypto scam he was also running.Mazini was arrested in March 2021 on kidnapping charges, after he kidnapped and beat someone who might have witnessed his frauds. He was sentenced to five years in prison for that charge, to which he pled guilty. His new fraud sentence will be served concurrently with the kidnapping sentence.In addition to seven years in prison, Mazini has been ordered to forfeit $10 million. Restitution has not yet been determined.\n",

Those who fell for the phishing link were redirected to a website that spoofed the real MicroStrategy website, with malicious code that drained funds.Around $440,000 was stolen thanks to the fake announcement, with the majority of it coming from one wallet that was drained of a variety of tokens notionally worth around $425,000.\n",

      "Summary: The user experience in crypto is apparently so bad that platforms can't even keep their own tokens straight. A web3 messaging project, Dechat, announced with some fanfare that the Dechat token would begin trading. In their social media post, however, they erroneously linked to the wrong token on the PancakeSwap cryptocurrency exchange. Instead of linking to the token they had developed, they included a link to a honeypot: that is, a malicious smart contract that aims to entice people to deposit funds that can then be stolen.\"You clowns literally linked a honeypot for your own token launch,\" wrote crypto sleuth zachxbt. Some users replied that they had lost money to the erroneous link.Dechat quickly removed the post and created a new one with a corrected link.

According to the community member, a successful governance proposal two months ago resulted in a code change, but malicious JavaScript included in the change went unnoticed.The code leaks private notes associated with deposits to a \"private malicious server\" owned by the person who initiated the code change. Private notes on Tornado Cash are the keys that allow a person to later withdraw the funds they have deposited into the mixing service.This is not the first time DAO governance has gone wrong for Tornado — in May 2023, the project underwent a hostile takeover via malicious code that went unnoticed.\n",

This has led to news reports that the platform was exploited for \"$290 million\". However, this value is being naively calculated based on the token price without taking into account the massive supply inflation, and ignoring that that dollar figure is more than 2.5x the total claimed market cap of the token. Even reputable outlets like Bleeping Computer have printed the figure in their headline (though Bleeping Computer later changed the headline to a more accurate one).PlayDapp sent on-chain messages to the attacker, offering a bounty, but the offer was ignored.\n",

However, when the network became congested, the attack suddenly became more profitable — and more noticeable.\n",

Some ETH and APE tokens were also stolen. Altogether, the stolen NFTs are priced at around $3 million, though the hacker may not be able to liquidate them for that ammount.One attacker claimed in on-chain messages that the original attack had been perpetrated by someone else, but that they were one of the many copycat attackers, describing themselves as someone who had \"[come] here to pick up residual garbage\". They requested victims send additional ETH to get their NFTs back. \"If you want the monkey nft back, then you need to pay me a bouty, which is what I deserve\", they wrote, asking for NFT holders to send them 10% of the Ape floor price.Meanwhile, NFT holders were urged to revoke access to NFT Trader, since the platform seemed aware of the attack but unable to stop it. NFT Trader was ultimately able to thwart the attacker to stem additional bleeding, likely thanks to help from community members who pointed out a way the contract could be shut down.Later, the \"residual garbage\" attacker returned 36 Bored Apes and 18 Mutant Apes after a Yuga Labs co-founder paid the 120 ETH (~$260,000) ransom.\n",

Several financial watchdogs issued warnings about the company, including the UK, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. The Hungarian central bank warned in August 2022 that the HyperVerse project was a \"suspected pyramid scheme... behind which there is no real economic activity... There is a significant chance that investors may permanently lose part or all of their invested capital.\"Estimates by Chainalysis suggest that victims have lost a combined $1.3 billion (with a B) to the scam thus far.The scheme's operators Sam Lee and Zijing \"Ryan\" Xu were also behind Blockchain Global, a collapsed company that operated the Australian ACX crypto exchange that collapsed in 2019. The company is in liquidation, and creditor claims are expected to surpass $50 million. Although Lee and Xu were reported for investigation to the Australian Securities & Investments Commission, ASIC did not take any action.Lee has also been involved in other investment platforms, including two that are currently active: StableDao and We Are All Satoshi.

Hoping to spark panic into crypto holders who had used the popular service, as well as other services like Uniswap which they were claiming were breached, the phishers shared links to sites that would supposedly help users revoke access to their wallets by those services, securing their assets. Instead, however, those malicious sites would drain the wallets.According to researcher zachxbt, who himself was one of the impersonated, the scammers have stolen more than $300,000 in various assets using this technique.This is not the first time such a technique has been used — a scammer attempted a similar, though less successful, scheme in April 2022. Scams like this take advantage of the poor UX in the crypto world for tracking and revoking wallet permissions that have been granted, requiring people to use third-party websites created for this purpose. Some of them are legitimate, but there are many malicious copies of these revocation sites that prey upon users who may be acting quickly in fear that their assets are at risk.\n",

When the visitor does so, the site downloads malware which then harvests information like login credentials.Attackers previously stored the malicious code on typical webhosting services, but those services began to take it down. Now, some have started using Binance's blockchain to store these payloads, taking advantage of the immutable nature of blockchains to prevent anyone from taking it down.\n",

By taking out the ad, the result is pushed to the top of the search results page, tricking unsuspecting victims into believing it's a legitimate search result.On August 21, an individual searched for \"celer bridge\" to find the website for the Celer blockchain bridge. The first result appeared legitimate, even displaying the correct URL for the actual Celer bridge. However, once they clicked the result, they were redirected to a phishing website.Once the victim connected their crypto wallet, it was immediately drained of $900,000 in the USDC stablecoin. They wrote on Twitter that it was \"most of [their] net worth\".\n",

It sounds unlikely to work, but users often fail to verify every character of the destination address they're using, opting instead to copy it from their transaction histories, and this can profit scammers substantially.Someone intending to transfer Tether stablecoins amounting to $20 million apparently didn't think it was important to double-check the address, and fell for such an attack.However, only 51 minutes after the theft, the victim had managed to get Tether to add the thief's address to its blacklist, freezing the assets and thwarting the attack.

The attack stemmed from an issue in the Vyper language, a smart contract programming language that is similar to Solidity. Early investigations suggested that versions of the Vyper compiler had improperly implemented a re-entrancy guard, leaving some projects vulnerable to that type of attack. Vyper tweeted an announcement that the versions were vulnerable, and urged \"projects relying on these versions [to] immediately reach out to us\".Curve itself lost $61 million to the exploit. AlchemixFi was exploited for around $13 million in assets, and JPEG'd suffered a $11 million loss. MetronomeDAO suffered a $1.6 million loss, Ellipsis Finance lost $68,600, and Debridge Finance lost around $24,600.Altogether, somewhere between $88 million and $100 million was taken, though some exploits appeared to be whitehat actions intended to preserve funds. The primary exploiter also later returned some of the stolen funds, refunding the entire amount to AlchemixFi and 90% of funds to JPEG'd in exchange for a 10% \"bug bounty\".\n",

      "Date: 2023-07-03\n",
      "Summary: After paying nearly $40 million for a new set of Azuki NFTs, the Azuki community is pissed that they were \"dilutive\" near-copies of the original Azuki collection. To fight back against the perceived \"blatant scamming\" by the Azuki creators, holders claiming to have collectively spent millions on Azuki projects formed an Azuki DAO. The DAO created a governance token, $BEAN, which it distributed to Azuki NFT owners. The DAO then embarked on a vote to hire a lawyer, sue Azuki's creator, and demand a refund of the 20,000 ETH (~$38 million) collectively spent on Elementals NFTs.However, shortly after the DAO was created, the governance token was exploited. Attackers were able to take advantage of a flaw in the smart contract, with two exploiters stealing around 35 ETH (~$69,000). The DAO paused the contract to prevent further thefts.File this one under \"adding insult to injury\".\n",

In reality, the exploiters were able to mint massive quantities of tokens on multiple networks, with their wallet balances showing numbers in the billions. However, complete lack of liquidity for these tokens meant their \"billions\" are worth substantially less.According to crypto research firm Beosin, the attackers have so far cashed out around 5,196 ETH (~$10.1 million) in liquid assets.

      "Summary: Themis Protocol is a lending platform that has had somewhat of an excruciating rollout, with users waiting ever longer for the platform to finally go live as they endured multiphased airdrops but no usable product. On June 16, the project finally launched in beta on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2.Only eleven days later, on June 27, the team boasted that the project \"has grown to over $1m TVL in 2 working days\". An hour after that, they announced that they would be suspending the protocol and beginning an immediate investigation into an apparent theft. Themis boasts in its documentation that \"security is the highest priority\" of the project, and lists multiple audits from PeckShield.An attacker was apparently able to exploit the project, draining around 220 Themis-wrapped ETH (nominally worth ~$417,000). Due to liquidity issues, they could only swap these for around 94 ETH (~$178,000) and almost $190,000 in stablecoins, for a total haul of around $368,000.\n",

      "Date: 2023-06-25\n",
      "Summary: According to a report from NPR, a crypto investment scam called SpireBit drained the life savings of a 74-year-old man in California. The scheme followed a familiar pattern: an online ad followed by some personalized recruiting convinced the man to put a relatively modest sum into an online account with a platform supposedly showing his crypto investments. After seeing those investments skyrocket, the man was convinced to put in more and more money, seeing massive returns. Only once he had put in his life savings did he try to withdraw, and discovered he could not. Ultimately, he realized the platform was a sham.SpireBit claimed to be partnered with established companies within and outside of the crypto ecosystem, and took on the name of a real company as its supposed \"parent\" firm. Its online footprint was convincing at a glance, but a little digging revealed LinkedIn profiles using stock photos as portraits.After NPR began poking around, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning that SpireBit \"is an unauthorised firm that uses the details of a genuine FCA-regulated firm when offering products and services. This makes the unauthorised firm appear as if it is regulated.\"NPR could not determine how many people had fallen for the scheme, or how much money had been lost in total.\n",

      "Summary: After the massive BNB Chain bridge hack in October 2022, the hacker was able to take out a massive position with the Venus Protocol defi lending project. They borrowed $150 million in stablecoins by putting up 900,000 BNB (~$244 million at the time).The recent SEC lawsuit against Binance has caused the BNB token to plummet almost 25%, from $305 to ~$230. This puts the hacker's position dangerously close to the liquidation threshold of $220, which could cause substantial impact on the market via cascading liquidations.In November, BNB Chain passed a governance proposal giving the BNB Chain core team the ability to liquidate the position if it approached the liquidation threshold, meaning they could repay the debt in a more controlled manner that wouldn't dump hundreds of thousands of BNB onto the market all at once.On June 12 the Venus team tweeted a reminder: \"BNBChain core team is ready to take over the $BNB position on Venus as planned if the BNB price hits the liquidation threshold. The liquidator address has prepared $30M already to refund the account loans with more to come if needed. No BNB will be dumped into the market and no shortfall is expected on Venus.\"This is not the only bad debt on the Venus platform, which has been described as \"opaque\" by Protos and has been accused of trying to hide some of its liabilities.\n",

Atomic Wallet is a self-custody wallet, a suggested safer alternative than storing crypto assets in accounts controlled by third party companies. In February 2022, a security firm was forced to publicly disclose issues with the Atomic Wallet software after attempting to address them with the company via traditional routes, but went ignored.Following the thefts, Atomic Wallet tweeted that they were aware of the reports of wallet compromises, and that they were attempting to learn more about the attacks, but had not yet confirmed any method of attack. They've since taken down the wallet software download page, likely out of concern that the software itself has been compromised.Crypto sleuth zachxbt compiled a list of reported compromised Atomic Wallets, finding that multiple individuals lost multiple millions in the attack.
