Contact Regulatory Authorities - The first step would be seeking guidance from cryptocurrency regulation and safety organizations like FATF (the Financial Action Task Force). Organizations such as these provide resources that may help in navigating the process of recovery, especially when working with entities accused to commit illics.\\n   \\n2.

What are some precautionary measures to prevent such insider attacks, based on documents you have examined using principles of security best practices in cryptoassets' world that could serve as an extension for this methodical process and how would these be implemented considering FATF guidelines without any generic advice or information?\\n   \\n4.

Report Theft or Fraud - As indicated by document C (Exfiltration of wallets after an inside attack), it's crucial to report any suspicious activity immediately, implying a prompt notification with your exchange platform possibly can stop transactions involving the stolen asset and initiate investigation could assist here since cryptocurrency exchanges often have security protocols in place.\\n \\n2.

At one point, Twitter even suspended the real Arbitrum Twitter account after mistaking it for one of the many phishing accounts. Attackers also compromised a Discord account belonging to an Arbitrum developer, using it to post a phishing link to the official Arbitrum Discord server.Then, when the time for the airdrop came, the token claiming website crashed on the traffic, as did the Arbitrum block explorer. Those who were able to claim their tokens paid exorbitant gas fees, and some wallets attempting to estimate required gas fees malfunctioned, showing estimates in the billions of dollars.Finally, the airdrop was widely gamed by people commandeering hacked vanity addresses to receive the airdrop tokens allocated to them, with at least $500,000 worth of tokens reportedly claimed by one attacker. Other attackers scrambled to compete with one another to claim tokens allocated to compromised wallets whose private keys had been shared publicly on Github and elsewhere, trying to be the first to siphon the funds. Two additional exploiters siphoned a combined total of more than 1\\u00a0million ARB tokens from other wallets. One sold them for 713\\u00a0ETH ($1.27\\u00a0million); the other transferred the ARB tokens to other wallets.\", \"id\": 259, \"question\": \"Was there any successful exploit in the Arbitrum airdrop event?
